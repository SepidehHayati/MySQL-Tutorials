# MySQL HandsOn for Data Analysis
This repository is a personal collection of MySQL exercises and examples inspired by the Data Analysis series by Alex on YouTube. It’s designed to help me review and strengthen my SQL skills while sharing useful resources with others.


## Folder Structure

- **Beginner MySQL**: This folder includes the basic SQL concepts, organized into 5 lesson files:
  - Writing basic `SELECT` queries
  - Filtering data with `WHERE` clauses
  - Grouping data using `GROUP BY` and ordering them with `ORDER BY`
  - Filtering data with `HAVING` clauses
  - Using `LIMIT` and creating aliases with `AS`
  - The _Beginner Level Practice_ file contains various practice queries to review and reinforce the basic concepts.

- **Intermediate MySQL**: In this folder, 6 more complex MySQL topics are covered, including:
  - Joining tables using different types of `JOIN`
  - Using `UNION` to combine result sets
  - Applying String functions for text manipulation
  - Implementing conditional logic with `CASE` statements
  - Writing Subqueries for more complex queries
  - Using Window functions for advanced data analysis
  - The _Intermediate Level Practice_ contains intermediate-level queries to practice the topics covered.

- **Advanced MySQL**: This section covers 4 advanced techniques for working with large datasets and more sophisticated MySQL concepts:
  - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for temporary result sets
  - Creating and using temporary tables (Temp Tables)
  - Writing and executing Stored Procedures for modular query management 
  - Working with Triggers and Events for automatic database management
  - The _Advanced Level Practice_ contains challenging queries and exercises for applying advanced MySQL concepts in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

Each folder contains SQL files that build upon MySQL concepts at each level. To use:
1. Start by running the dataset file in each folder to create tables and insert sample data for the lessons.
2. Open the `.sql` file for the lesson in your SQL environment.
3. Run the queries step-by-step to see how the output changes.
4. Use the practice file to apply what you've learned.

## Prerequisites

To run these MySQL scripts, you'll need:
- **MySQL** or a similar SQL database installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of SQL commands and how to execute them within a database management tool, like **MySQL Workbench**.


Feel free to modify the queries or create your own as you progress through each level!
