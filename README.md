# MySQL HandsOn for Data Analysis
This repository is a personal collection of MySQL exercises and examples inspired by the Data Analysis series by Alex on YouTube. Itâ€™s designed to help me review and strengthen my SQL skills while sharing useful resources with others.


## Folder Structure

- **Beginner MySQL**: This folder includes the basic SQL concepts, organized into 5 lesson files: 
  - How to `CREATE DATABASE`
  - How to `USE` database
  - How to `CREATE TABLE`
  - Writing basic `SELECT` queries
  - Filtering data with `WHERE` clauses
  - Grouping data using `GROUP BY` and ordering them with `ORDER BY`
  - Filtering data with `HAVING` clauses
  - Using `LIMIT` and creating aliases with `AS`
  - `DROP` table
  - `PRIMARY KEY`
  - `FOREIGN KEY`
  - `UNIQUE KEY INDEX`
  - `ALTER`, `CHANGE`, `DEFAULT`
  - `MODIFY`, `CHANGE`, `NUL`, `NOT NULL`
  - How to `INSERT`
  - How to `UPDATE` 
  - How to `DELETE`
  - The _Beginner Level Practice_ file contains various practice queries to review and reinforce the basic concepts.

- **Intermediate MySQL**: In this folder, 6 more complex MySQL topics are covered, including:
  - Joining tables using different types of `JOIN`
  - Using `UNION` to combine result sets
  - Applying String functions for text manipulation
  - Implementing conditional logic with `CASE` statements
  - Writing Subqueries for more complex queries
  - Using Window functions for advanced data analysis
  - The _Intermediate Level Practice_ contains intermediate-level queries to practice the topics covered.

- **Advanced MySQL**: This section covers 4 advanced techniques for working with large datasets and more sophisticated MySQL concepts:
  - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for temporary result sets
  - Creating and using temporary tables (Temp Tables)
  - Writing and executing Stored Procedures for modular query management 
  - Working with Triggers and Events for automatic database management
  - The _Advanced Level Practice_ contains challenging queries and exercises for applying advanced MySQL concepts in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

Each folder contains SQL files that build upon MySQL concepts at each level. To use:
1. Start by running the dataset file in each folder to create tables and insert sample data for the lessons.
2. Open the `.sql` file for the lesson in your SQL environment.
3. Run the queries step-by-step to see how the output changes.
4. Use the practice file to apply what you've learned.

## Prerequisites

To run these MySQL scripts, you'll need:
- **MySQL** or a similar SQL database installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of SQL commands and how to execute them within a database management tool, like **MySQL Workbench**.


Feel free to modify the queries or create your own as you progress through each level!
